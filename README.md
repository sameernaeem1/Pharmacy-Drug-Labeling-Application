# Pharmacy-Drug-Labeling-Application

  This application was designed for pharmacists to use when giving drugs to patients.  
  The first part is a label creator:  
  They select a drug from a list and the advice for that specific drug is automatically written to a label from a database.  
  They can then enter other patient specific details such as name and allergies along with the date.  
  The label can then be saved to a patient database.  
  The second part is a patient history page:  
  The user must first login to authorise their credentials. The username and Password are both currently 'pharmacy'.  
  Once successfully logged in, the pharmacist can view all previously created labels in a table and print this information off.  
  Finally, there is a link to the emc website if any additional information is needed.
